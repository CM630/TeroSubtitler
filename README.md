## Contributions

We appreciate anyone who can offer skills towards the project (additions and refinements), and there is a desire for volunteers who can assist in the following roles/tasks:
- App designer (improving Tero Subtitler's UI and UX)
- Coders (resolving issues and developing features)
- Localization (reaching more people)
- Manual editor (for Tero Subtitler)
- Subtitling consultant (for QC and keeping abreast of industry developments)
- Video producer (for social media)
- Web designer (for URUWorks)

We encourage public discussions (ideally in English) to avoid the doubling of work and reach agreements with others:
- If there are questions or proposals, please create a topic (after searching for existing ones) in Discussions before heading to Issues.
- Users can join our Discord channel for queries and discussions (using the relevant category).

## History

URUWorks' subtitling solution began as Subtitle Workshop. In making the distinction from the other project with the same name, the organization is retiring that repository in favor of Tero Subtitler.

## Donations

Over an estimated 20 years of development on URUWorks programs, economic assistance (to cover hosting and software costs, etc.) has been minimal. We firmly believe in free software, and that all software for personal use must be free. Hence, Tero Subtitler (and ViPlay) will always be made available to anyone who likes or finds them useful, never to become shareware programs. To continually improve them, however, we would really appreciate a donation via PayPal or your support on Patreon. Please remember that this is voluntary; you will not receive any less support or consideration.
